# PowerBuilder OOP Design Patterns

This repository demonstrates how to use OOP design patterns and Github Actions for PowerBuilder projects.

* In the [docs](/docs) folder, you will find two slide decks about those topics.
* In the [diagrams](/diagrams) folder, you will find the PlantUML files for the diagrams in the OOP slide deck.

## How to build

You can either run the application using the PowerBuilder IDE or compile it using make and PowerBuilder Utilitites (`make run`).

The workflow files are just examples.
In order to use them, you need to pack your own PowerBuilder compiler files and make them available to the Github Runner.
